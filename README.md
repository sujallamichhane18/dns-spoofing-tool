# DNS Spoofing Simulation Tool üöÄ

## Overview
This DNS Spoofing Simulation Tool is designed **for educational purposes only**. It demonstrates how DNS spoofing and ARP poisoning can be used in a controlled lab environment to simulate a man‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëmiddle (MITM) attack. **Use responsibly!**

> **Disclaimer:**  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool is for educational and ethical testing only.  
> Unauthorized use on public or production networks is illegal.  
> By using this tool, you agree to use it solely in environments where you have explicit permission.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è
- **DNS Spoofing:** Continuously sends forged DNS responses to redirect traffic for a specific domain.
- **ARP Poisoning:** Positions the attack machine as a man‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëmiddle between the victim and the gateway.
- **Continuous Operation:** Runs indefinitely until manually stopped (CTRL+C).
- **Automatic Restoration:** Attempts to restore ARP tables when the attack is stopped.

## Tech Stack üíª
- **Python 3**  
- **Scapy:** For packet crafting and network operations.
- **Threading & Signal Handling:** To manage continuous operations and graceful exits.

## Installation üì¶

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dns-spoofing-simulation-tool.git
   cd dns-spoofing-simulation-tool
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Make sure `scapy` is installed.*

## Usage üö¶

1. **Run the Tool with Elevated Privileges:**

   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```bash
     sudo python3 dns_spoofing_tool.py
     ```
   - **Windows:**  
     Run your Command Prompt as Administrator and execute:
     ```bash
     python dns_spoofing_tool.py
     ```

2. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - **Victim's IP Address:** (e.g., `192.1x.x.2`)
   - **Gateway/DNS Server IP Address:** (e.g., `192.x.x.1`)
   - **Domain to Spoof:** (e.g., `www.exapmle.com`)
   - **Fake IP Address:** (e.g., `192.x.x.56`)

3. **Stop the Tool:**
   - Press **CTRL+C** to gracefully stop the attack. The script will attempt to restore the network settings automatically.
