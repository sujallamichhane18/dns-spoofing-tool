# DNS Spoofing Simulation Tool

## Overview
The DNS Spoofing Simulation Tool is designed to simulate DNS spoofing/poisoning attacks on DNS resolvers, visualize DNS cache poisoning in real-time, and provide recommendations for securing DNS infrastructures. It helps test the security of DNS servers or local networks against DNS spoofing attacks.

## Features
- Simulate DNS poisoning attacks and visualize DNS cache poisoning.
- Real-time traffic capture and analysis.
- Provide actionable security recommendations (e.g., DNSSEC).
- Open-source and deployable locally.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Scapy**: For crafting and sending DNS spoofing packets.
- **Streamlit**: To build an interactive web interface.
- **Socket Programming**: For network communication handling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Administrator/root privileges may be required to send packets.

### Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dns-spoofing-simulation-tool.git
cd dns-spoofing-simulation-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Tool**:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. **How to Use**:
   - Enter the target DNS resolver's IP, the malicious IP to spoof, and the domain to redirect.
   - Capture DNS traffic and visualize the attack.
   - View security recommendations such as enabling DNSSEC.

### Recommendations to Prevent DNS Spoofing:
- Enable DNSSEC to authenticate DNS responses.
- Use DNS resolvers that support DNSSEC validation.
- Regularly monitor DNS traffic for unusual activity.
- Use firewalls and restrict DNS queries to trusted sources.
